# LIS Generator (Previously lol-picture-generate-for-stream)
A small Javascript software who retrieve data from Riot API to generate a pregame picture (Username, Champion, Summoners, and Perks {Runes]...) and a postgame picture on a game (Team win, stats, damage graph, gold graph...).

Works (but still under development)
